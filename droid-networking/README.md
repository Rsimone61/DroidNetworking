NDNetworking
====================

The goal of NDNetworking is:

* Use Apache HTTP client when running Eclair or Froyo
* Use HttpURLConnection for Gingerbread and better
* Support both memory and disk cache fully compliant with HTTP spec.
* Handle a single queue that executes requests
* Auto queue sizing depending on bandwith and connection
* Response can be read as data, string or stream
* Requests can be cancelled based on Class or URL
* ... and more 

NDNetworking is heavily inspired by MKNetworkKit: https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit/
